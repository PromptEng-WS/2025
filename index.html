	    The recent achievements and availability of Large Language
	    Models has paved the road to a new range of applications
	    and use-cases. Pre-trained language models are now being
	    involved at-scale in many fields where they were until now
	    absent from. More specifically, the progress made by
	    causal generative models has opened the door to using them
	    through textual instructions <i>aka.</i> <b>prompts</b>.
	    Unfortunately, the performances of these prompts are
	    highly dependent on the exact phrasing used and therefore
	    practitioners need to adopt fail-retry strategies.

	  <blockquote>
	    <p>
	      In a nutshell, PromptEng provides the research community
	      with a forum to discuss, exchange and design advanced
	      prompting techniques for LLM applications.
	    </p>
	  </blockquote>
	  <p>
	    This second international workshop on prompt engineering
	    aims at gathering practitioners (both from Academia and
	    Industry) to exchange good practices, optimizations,
	    results and novel paradigms about the designing of
	    efficient prompts to make use of LLMs.

	  <p>
	    Undoubtedly, the recent Large Language Models (LLMs) are
	    becoming more and more omnipotent in many tasks. Different
	    sub-fields from the Semantic Web such as Knowledge Graph
	    construction, knowledge verbalization, Web pages
	    summarization have considerably benefited from such a
	    prompting mechanism. The ability to query and interact
	    with them using prompts is crucial to generate
	    high-quality output in the desired format. While existing
	    contributions have been made towards prompt engineering,
	    several difficulties and challenges remain to gain a
	    better understanding of how those LLMs respond to
	    different prompts. Typically, the way instructions are
	    conveyed in prompts can lead to either distinct or similar
	    output from the models.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Moreover, some instructions are better respected while
	    others are simply ignored for some tasks. So far,
	    LLM-practitioners have been mainly working on their own,
	    developing and testing bespoke techniques to achieve their
	    goals, re-starting the prompt-design tasks for each new
	    model they have been using. Such an approach often leads
	    to tackle problems which have already been explored by
	    other researchers.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This workshop aims to investigate and analyze these
	    behaviors, through experimental analysis and probing of
	    LLMs, in order to gain insights into the models'
	    sensitivity to different prompts. By uncovering
	    significant findings, the community can greatly benefit in
	    utilizing LLMs more effectively while also preventing the
	    generation of harmful content.  Ultimately, this workshop
	    endeavors to compile and index successful and unavailing
	    prompts with respect to both tasks and models.
